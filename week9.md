**Learning Activities & Resources**
This week, I worked on creating a small flower shop website using HTML, SCSS, and CSS, focusing on the practical application of Sass features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. To streamline my workflow, I utilized Sass compilation tools and manually compiled SCSS files to produce clean CSS output. Additionally, I explored color schemes and advanced CSS properties to enhance the website's visual appeal.

**Resources Used:**
Sass Documentation: sass-lang.com
LinkedIn Learning Course: Sass Essentials
SCSS Best Practices Article: Smashing Magazine

**Time Spent:**
Approximately 5 hours, which included setup, coding, and troubleshooting the Sass compilation process.

**Content Insights**
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into Sass's capabilities and practical application in web development. Key learnings include:

Variables: Defined reusable values for colors, fonts, and other elements to maintain consistency across the website. For example, $primary-color: #ff6f61; served as the theme's primary color.
Nesting: Organized CSS in a logical and structured way, grouping related styles together, such as nesting .header and .nav within a header block.
Mixins: Created reusable CSS snippets for consistent button styles, enabling flexibility in properties like border-radius.
Extend/Inheritance: Used @extend to share styles between elements like buttons and cards, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.
By leveraging Sass, I found the development process far more efficient compared to writing traditional CSS, especially for managing complex projects or implementing quick modifications.

**Career/Employability Insights**
This project improved my ability to manage and organize stylesheets effectively using Sass, a crucial skill in front-end web development.

I also deepened my understanding of the role visual design plays in user engagement. Applying color theory to the flower shop website underscored the importance of aesthetics in creating user-friendly and appealing interfaces.

From a career standpoint, I feel more confident in tackling web development tasks that involve CSS preprocessors like Sass. These skills are essential for building responsive, visually appealing websites and optimizing workflows, which are valuable assets in professional front-end development roles.
