**Week 7**

**Learning Activities & Resources** 
This week, I focused on learning and practicing PHP, a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. My activities included:

Completing tutorials and coding exercises on PHP basics.
Writing PHP scripts to demonstrate various fundamental concepts.
Exploring practical implementations, such as embedding PHP into HTML and creating reusable components with include().

**Resources Used**: 
PHP Manual â€“ Official documentation for syntax and function reference.
Online learning platforms like LinkedIn Learning and W3Schools for structured lessons.
IDEs like Visual Studio Code for writing and testing PHP code.

**Estimated Hours**
I spent approximately 15 hours this week, combining tutorials, practical exercises. The learning emphasized the importance of clean, modular code and how PHP integrates seamlessly with databases for dynamic applications.

**Insights on Content**

Key topics covered:

PHP Basics:

Syntax:
 Writing scripts within <?php ?> tags.
Printing output using echo and print.
Using variables and constants.

Control Structures:
if/else statements for decision-making.
switch cases for managing multiple conditions.

Loops:
for, while, and foreach loops for iteration.
Practical use cases like iterating through arrays.

Functions:
Creating reusable code blocks with parameters and return values.
Understanding the difference between built-in and user-defined functions.

Include and Require:
