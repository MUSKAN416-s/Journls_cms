Learning Activities:
This week, I focused on using WordPress to build and customize a theme for a Dog Club website. I installed WordPress locally using MAMP, explored the Twenty Twenty theme, and created a child theme to ensure safe customization. My tasks included modifying the layout, adjusting colors and fonts, and adding specific features such as a membership plugin and event calendar to meet the Dog Club’s requirements. I used the Gutenberg editor to structure content and enhance visual appeal.
